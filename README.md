This means that it

1. can be used to create a simple contact form in one minute
2. can be modified to be any other form you need
3. can be used as a starting point for your own AJAX forms in DNN

The app is built with the [pattern **Don't be DAFT**][daft] (DAFT = Densely Abstract Features for Techies), aka the **Anti-Abstraction** pattern.
So customizing it is mostly done using common technologies like HTML, JS and some C#.

## Quick Intro To The Mobius Forms App for DNN

A [DNN App][2sxc] is like a DNN module, just way better 😉.
Since this is an open-code/open-source 2sxc-app, you can customize it to be anything you want!
This list just shows what it already does, so you know what you get out-of-the-first-box.

1. Pre-Built Forms for use or learning
    1. Basic contact form with _Subject, Message, Name, E-Mail_
    1. A support-request form with a dropdown-example
    1. An example with JS show/hide logic and saving raw JSON-data
1. **AJAX**, so no page reloads for validation, sending or messages
1. **Recaptcha** (optional) validation on client and server
1. data is saved, together with the _Timestamp_, _SenderIP_, optionaly generated _Title_ or even raw JSON-data
1. sends [various e-mails][cust-mail], which are **razor-templateable** and has **Reply-To** and **CC** options
1. **multi-language** labels and messages, already translated into English and German/Deutsch
1. field validation uses [html5 and pristinejs][pristine-js] and works with multiple forms on the same page
1. you can easily **review / manage / filter** the submitted items in a table-view
1. **export all submissions** into an Excel-compatible XML format
1. **open code C# WebApi** easy to customize if you ever need to

Because it's so simple and uses 2sxc, you can easily

* [translate it into any other language in minutes][translate]
* [add more fields, even with special validation in minutes][cust-field]
* [customize the e-mail templates][cust-mail]
* send more e-mails, trigger other [custom WebApi actions][cust-webapi]
* create [more custom forms][add-forms] which store into further content-types

## Getting Started

This app is only useful is you use DNN or Oqtane. So assuming you have a DNN installation, all you need to do is install 2sxc and this app.

* Here's how to [install 2sxc and an App of your Choice](https://2sxc.org/en/apps/app/mobius-forms-v5-with-mailchimp-recaptcha-polymorph-weback-and-more-hybrid-for-dnn-and-oqtane)

* Now you can use this app as-is, or customize it to be whatever you need it to be.

* It probably helps to review the [Overview][overview] about how the parts play together by default, so you can then change as little as necessary to get it to do what you want

## Customize the App

The Source Code is all here - so you can easily customize to your hearts desire!
